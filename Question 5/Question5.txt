Explain, using relevant examples, the strategy for querying MongoDB (all CRUD operations)?

"Find" look in the data collection and find a specific document/object and return that. 
"Add" save object to database, using insert() from mongodb.
"Delete" look in the data collection and find the specific document /object and delete it.
