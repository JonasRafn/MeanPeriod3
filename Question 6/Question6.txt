Demonstrate, using a REST-API, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB?

Instead of using the res.render function you can use the res.json function to return
the data gathered from your MongoDB as a json response. You can still use the same
"CRUD layer" (jokes.js) as for an app using handlebars or jade.

The RandomJoke.js is one of the routes from my joke app, here i am using res.render
if i wanted to change it to a rest api i could simply use res.json.
