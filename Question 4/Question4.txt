Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB?

When using Mongoose, or a similar middleware, to add a schema to your NoSQL database, there can be multiple
reasons. 
1. "Schema Validation" 
You might want the entries in your database to have some specific data. In our joke app, it would make no sense
to save a joke object if there was no joke, but we might be okay with the fact that there is no author.

2. "Better Syntax"
Mongoose also provide some help with using the MongoDB, the syntax Mongoose uses looks more like SQL or JPQL, 
which many developers have used before.
