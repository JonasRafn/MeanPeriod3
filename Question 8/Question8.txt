Explain how redis "fits" into the NoSQL world?

One of the most apparent use cases for Redis is using it as a Session Store. The advantages of 
using Redis over other session stores, is that Redis offers persistence. While maintaining a 
cache isn't typically mission critical with regards to consistency, most users wouldn't exactly 
enjoy if all their cart sessions went away.

Redis can also be used for storing login data as it is fast to serch for a value in Redis.
