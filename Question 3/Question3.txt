Explain how databases like MongoDB and redis would be classified in the NoSQL world?

MongoDB is a Document database, this means that all the data is saved in documents, you can think of 
it as all being saved in .txt files on the harddrive. 

Redis is a Key Value database, that is saved in-memory this way you can think of a Redis database, 
as a giant Hash -Map, -set, etc. Where every value is saved with a key you search, this is also 
1 of the reasons its often used for holding user login data.
